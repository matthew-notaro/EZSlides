A defining feature of the kind of dynamic game we’ve studied so far,
dynamic games of perfect information, is that players’ actions are never
taken simultaneously—all actions are sequential.

We are ready to graduate to a more general concept of a dynamic game,
in which some actions by players can be chosen simultaneously.

Of course, not all actions are simultaneous, or else it would be a regular
multaneous-move game, not a dynamic game.

Adjustment to outcomes

For instance, we might group actions taken simultaneously in
parentheses.

As an example, suppose an outcome of a dynamic game is
X(XYX)(XZ). We would interpret that as meaning, “in this outcome,
the player who went first chose action X, with no other player choosing
anything simultaneously; after that, three players made choices
simultaneously, with two of those players choosing action X and the
third choosing action Y; then two players made choices simultaneously,
with one of them choosing action X and the other choosing action Z;
then the game ended.”

Adjustments to the Player Function

The idea of a history of the game is that it is any record of actions that
could be taken to start a play of the game, up to a certain point, but not
necessarily to finish it.

In a dynamic game of perfect information, that is simply any sequence
of actions that appears at the beginning of an outcome.

Going back to our prior example, if XYZX is an outcome of a dynamic
game, then X, XY, and XYZ are all histories of the game (and @, of
course).

Adjustment to outcomes

For instance, we might group actions taken simultaneously in
parentheses.

As an example, suppose an outcome of a dynamic game is
X(XYX)(XZ). We would interpret that as meaning, “in this outcome,
the player who went first chose action X, with no other player choosing
anything simultaneously; after that, three players made choices
simultaneously, with two of those players choosing action X and the
third choosing action Y; then two players made choices simultaneously,
with one of them choosing action X and the other choosing action Z;
then the game ended.”

The idea of a history of the game is that it is any record of actions that
could be taken to start a play of the game, up to a certain point, but not
necessarily to finish it.

In a dynamic game of perfect information, that is simply any sequence
of actions that appears at the beginning of an outcome.

Going back to our prior example, if XYZX is an outcome of a dynamic

parentheses.

As an example, suppose an outcome of a dynamic game is
X(XYX)(XZ). We would interpret that as meaning, “in this outcome,
the player who went first chose action X, with no other player choosing
anything simultaneously; after that, three players made choices
simultaneously, with two of those players choosing action X and the
third choosing action Y; then two players made choices simultaneously,
with one of them choosing action X and the other choosing action Z;
then the game ended.”

A defining feature of the kind of dynamic game we’ve studied so far,
dynamic games of perfect information, is that players’ actions are never
taken simultaneously—all actions are sequential.

We are ready to graduate to a more general concept of a dynamic game,
in which some actions by players can be chosen simultaneously.

Of course, not all actions are simultaneous, or else it would be a regular
multaneous-move game, not a dynamic game.

For instance, we might group actions taken simultaneously in
parentheses.

As an example, suppose an outcome of a dynamic game is
X(XYX)(XZ). We would interpret that as meaning, “in this outcome,
the player who went first chose action X, with no other player choosing
anything simultaneously; after that, three players made choices
simultaneously, with two of those players choosing action X and the
third choosing action Y; then two players made choices simultaneously,
with one of them choosing action X and the other choosing action Z;
then the game ended.”

A defining feature of the kind of dynamic game we’ve studied so far,
dynamic games of perfect information, is that players’ actions are never
taken simultaneously—all actions are sequential.

We are ready to graduate to a more general concept of a dynamic game,
in which some actions by players can be chosen simultaneously.

Of course, not all actions are simultaneous, or else it would be a regular
multaneous-move game, not a dynamic game.

For instance, we might group actions taken simultaneously in
parentheses.

As an example, suppose an outcome of a dynamic game is
X(XYX)(XZ). We would interpret that as meaning, “in this outcome,
the player who went first chose action X, with no other player choosing
anything simultaneously; after that, three players made choices
simultaneously, with two of those players choosing action X and the
third choosing action Y; then two players made choices simultaneously,
with one of them choosing action X and the other choosing action Z;

Adjustments to the Player Function

The idea of a history of the game is that it is any record of actions that
could be taken to start a play of the game, up to a certain point, but not
necessarily to finish it.

Ina dynamic game of perfect information, that is simply any sequence
of actions that appears at the beginning of an outcome.

Going back to our prior example, if XYZX is an outcome of a dynamic
game, then X, XY, and XYZ are all histories of the game (and @, of

Adjustment to outcomes

With the possibility of simultaneous moves, outcomes are still lists of
actions, and it is still true that if one action is taken before another, the
first action appears before the second in the list. However, some actions
in the list may have been taken simultaneously.

In this case, we indicate this in our list by grouping actions taken
simultaneously together, using some kind of notation.

A defining feature of the kind of dynamic game we’ve studied so far,
dynamic games of perfect information, is that players’ actions are never
taken simultaneously—all actions are sequential.

We are ready to graduate to a more general concept of a dynamic game,
in which some actions by players can be chosen simultaneously.

Of course, not all actions are simultaneous, or else it would be a regular
simultaneous-move game, not a dynamic game.

Finding SPNE of dynamic
games with simultaneous moves

 
 

The definition of a subgame is the same in dynamic games with
simultaneous moves as in dynamic games of perfect information: at any
proper subhistory, there is a subgame that begins at that proper
subhistory.

Our method of finding subgame perfect Nash equilibria is also similar:
we perform backward induction by first analyzing subgames at the
“end” of the game, then working our way back toward the beginning.
 

Example

Here is a dynamic game with simultaneous moves, and two players. In
this game, player 1 moves first, by herself, and chooses action X or
action Y. If she chooses action X, the game ends. If she chooses action
Y, then players 1 and 2 next choose actions simultaneously, with 1
choosing either action U or action D, and 2 choosing either action L or
action R.

Payoffs will be specified later.
 

In a dynamic game of perfect information, a subgame at the “end”
means a subgame in which the only thing that happens is that one player
chooses one action, and then the game ends.

With the possibility of simultaneous moves, a subgame at the “end”
means a subgame that consists only of single round of moves, after
which the game ends. However, a round might consist of simultaneous
actions by multiple players. That is, it is not a one-player subgame,
but a multiplayer simultaneous-move subgame.
A defining feature of the kind of dynamic game we've studied so far,

dynaniic games of perfect information, is that players’ actions are never
taken simultaneonsly—all actions are sequential.

We are ready to gracluate to a more general concept of a dynamic game,
in which sore actions by players can be chosen simulte neously.

Of course, not aii aciions are simu iianeous, or eise 1t wCuid be a reguiar
simultaneous-move game, not a dynamic game.

 
Allowing for simultaneous moves will require us to change some of the
formal elements that define a dynamic game.

To review, a dynamic game of perfect information is defined by:

--the set of players

--the set of outcomes, defined as sequences of actions that take the game from
its beginning to its completion

--a player function, which tells us which player is making the next choice at
any proper subhistory

Adjustment to outcomes

For instance, we might group actions taken simultaneously in
parentheses.

As an example, suppose an outcome of a dynamic game is
X(XYX)(XZ). We would interpret that as meaning, “in this outcome,
the player who went first chose action X, with no other player choosing
anything simultaneously; after that, three players made choices
simultaneously, with two of those players choosing action X and the
third choosing action Y; then two players made choices simultaneously,
with one of them choosing action X and the other choosing action Z;
then the game ended.”

With the possibility of simultaneous moves, outcomes are still lists of
actions, and it is still true that if one action is taken before another, the
first action appears before the second in the list. However, some actions
in the list may have been taken simultaneously.

In this case, we indicate this in our list by grouping actions taken

A defining feature of the kind of dynamic game we’ve studied so far,
dynamic games of perfect information, is that players’ actions are never
taken simultaneously—all actions are sequential.

We are ready to graduate to a more general concept of a dynamic game,
in which some actions by players can be chosen simultaneously.

Of course, not all actions are simultaneous, or else it would be a regular
simultaneous-move game, not a dynamic game.

Adjustment to outcomes

With no simultaneous actions, an outcome is interpreted as a set of
actions that were taken in sequence. For instance, if XYZX is an
outcome of a dynamic game of perfect information, that means that one
way for the game to be played is, “the player who goes first chooses
action X, then a player chooses action Y, then a player chooses action Z,
then a player chooses action X, at which point the game ends.”

Adjustments to the Player Function

The idea of a history of the game is that it is any record of actions that
could be taken to start a play of the game, up to a certain point, but not
necessarily to finish it.

In a dynamic game of perfect information, that is simply any sequence
of actions that appears at the beginning of an outcome.

Going back to our prior example, if XYZX is an outcome of a dynamic
game, then X, XY, and XYZ are all histories of the game (and @, of
course).
