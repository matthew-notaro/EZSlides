We also need to change the structure of the player function when the
dynamic game allows some simultaneous moves.
b

One reason is that the structure of histories of the game is different.
 
   

Adjustment to outcomes

  

Allowing these groupings of consecutive actions to show simultaneity is
the only change we need to make to our notion of outcomes.

Adjustments to the Player Function

The idea of a history of the game is that it is any record of actions that
could be taken to start a play of the game, up to a certain point, but not
necessarily to finish it.

In a dynamic game of perfect information, that is simply any sequence
of actions that appears at the beginning of an outcome.

Going back to our prior example, if XYZX is an outcome of a dynamic
game, then X, XY, and XYZ are all histories of the game (and @, of
course).
 

Allowing for simultaneous moves will require us to change some of the
formal elements that define a dynamic game.

To review, a dynamic game of perfect information is defined by:
--the set of players

--the set of outcomes, defined as sequences of actions that take the game from
its beginning to its completion

--a player function, which tells us which player is making the next choice at
any proper subhistory

--players’ payoffs at each outcome
 

A defining feature of the kind of dynamic game we’ve studied so far,
dynamic games of perfect information, is that players’ actions are never
taken simultaneously—all actions are sequential.

We are ready to graduate to a more general concept of a dynamic game,
in which some actions by players can be chosen simultaneously.

Of course, not all actions are simultaneous, or else it would be a regular
simultaneous-move game, not a dynamic game.

Adjustment to outcomes

With no simultaneous actions, an outcome is interpreted as a set of
actions that were taken in sequence. For instance, if XYZX is an
outcome of a dynamic game of perfect information, that means that one
way for the game'to be played is, “the player who goes first chooses
action X, then a player chooses action Y, then a player chooses action Z,
then a player chooses action X, at which point the game ends.”
Allowing simultaneous moves will not require changing the notion of a
player or a payoff, but will require changing the notion of an outcome
and a player function.

 
 
     
   
 
    

Adjustment to outcomes

With the possibility of simultaneous moves, outcomes are still lists of
actions, and it is still true that if one action is taken before another, the
first action appears before the second in the list. However, some actions
in the list may have been taken simultaneously.

In this case, we indicate this in our list by grouping actions taken
simultaneously together, using some kind of notation.
 
   

    

Adjustment to outcomes

For instance, we might group actions taken simultaneously in
parentheses.

As an example, suppose an outcome of a dynamic game is
X(XYX)(XZ). We would interpret that as meaning, “in this outcome,
the player who went first chose action X, with no other player choosing
anything simultaneously; after that, three players made choices
simultaneously, with two of those players choosing action X and the
third choosing action Y; then two players made choices simultaneously,
with one of them choosing action X and the other choosing action Z;
then the game ended.”
