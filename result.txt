Expanded Dynamic Games: Allowing for Simultaneous Moves 7/48 | - wx +) O

Adjustment to outcomes

For instance, we might group actions taken simultaneously in
parentheses.

As an example, suppose an outcome of a dynamic game is
X(XYX)(XZ). We would interpret that as meaning, “in this outcome,
the player who went first chose action X, with no other player choosing
anything simultaneously; after that, three players made choices
simultaneously, with two of those players choosing action X and the
third choosing action Y; then two players made choices simultaneously,
with one of them choosing action X and the other choosing action Z;
then the game ended.”
